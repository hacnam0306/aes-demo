Advanced Encryption Standard(AES) is a symmetric encryption algorithm. AES is the industry standard as of now as it allows 128 bit, 192 bit and 256 bits encryption. Symmetric encryption is rapid as compared to asymmetric encryption and are used in systems such as database system. Following is an online tool to perform AES encryption and decryption of any plain-text or password.

The tool provides multiple modes of encryption and decryption such as ECB, CBC, CTR and GCM mode. GCM is considered more secure than CBC mode and is widely adopted for its performance.
